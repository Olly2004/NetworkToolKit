ok apparently you can add yourself to the router without it knowing you are there

so instead of DCHP assigning you an IP address therefore router being involved and logging you
you can join adn assign urself a static IP and stuff
so its like crashing a house party

normally you knock (DHCP request)
the host (router) woudl let me in and remember im here and stuff (MAC/IP/time)
i then sit somewhere (get assigned an IP) therefore im officially on teh lease log

first issue i see tho is if im assiging my own IP what if someone joins and DHCP assigns that same IP would there just be errors
errors such as sending packets to one or the other
